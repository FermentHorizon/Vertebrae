Vertebrae toolhead for the Voron 0
This is the Vertebrae toolhead for the Voron 0 using an MGN9C carriage.
The plate is made from a piece of 32mm wide x 3mm aluminium plate, print the part to use as a drill guide or output a DXF to get it cut.
Fasteners for the fans are M2 with M2 brass inserts into the body, the top plate uses 2 M3 brass inserts.
This currently only supports Volcomosq and Sherpa mini but this will change in time.

n.b. This was never intended for public release and is definitely very beta, please be aware that at the present time I am unable to offer any support but I will attempt to update this as changes are made, I have just thrown it up here due to demand.
